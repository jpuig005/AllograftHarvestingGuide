**WARNING** The mm API distribution which the program is done is compatible with meshmixer 3.0 and 32-bit Python 2.7.
It may not work with previous or later versions of meshmixer or Python. Before running it you need to install
mm API, to install it you just need to download and extract the file called mm-api-master (1).7z. It is the mm API (found here: https://github.com/meshmixer/mm-api) but with some modifications.

To run the program just open meshmixer and start running the first script (S1), follow the instructions until the file ends, once it ends you can open the following one until S6.

Technical Notes
===============

On S1 you have to change the name of the fr_bone and dt_bone. They are the two stl files that cotain the mesh of the graft and the fracture.

On S3 the name of the tube being used can also be changed, at the moment is the: "TubeShortFat.stl" 

Important notes
===============

The code is still in development so many of the steps may not be clear
